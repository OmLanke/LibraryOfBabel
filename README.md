## Introduction
Welcome to the repository dedicated to addressing the issue of substandard medical textbooks in the context of Ayurveda, Unani, and Siddha (ASU) systems of medicine. This project aims to shed light on the challenges faced by medical students and professionals due to the prevalence of inadequate study materials in ASU education.

## Problem Statement
The problem we address here is the widespread availability of substandard medical textbooks within ASU systems. These textbooks have a detrimental impact on the quality of medical education, hindering the development of competent healthcare practitioners. Insufficient or misleading study resources can misguide students and impair their ability to acquire accurate and comprehensive medical knowledge.

## Solution
Our project focuses on finding solutions to the substandard medical textbook issue. We explore strategies to improve the quality of educational materials within ASU systems. This includes the development of an assessment scale to evaluate textbook quality, engaging subject-wise reviewers to scrutinize textbooks, and creating an online platform for global input and data summarization. Our goal is to enhance the selection of high-quality medical literature in ASU education.
